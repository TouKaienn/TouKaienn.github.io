I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.nd.edu/) at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), working in the ND-VIS research group under the supervision of [Prof. Chaoli Wang](https://sites.nd.edu/chaoli-wang/). Prior to this, I earned my B.S. degree from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) in 2022.

My exisiting research focuses on the intersection of scientific visualization, computer graphics, and machine learning, including volumetric data generation and compression, as well as 3D scene representation and editing. Recently, I've become especially interested in emerging techniques in 3D vision, such as foundation models and MLLMs, and I believe exploring their potential applications in scientific visualization is a fascinating direction.

One thing I find quite amusing is that although I‚Äôve already published several papers during my PhD, due to visa issues and some unexpected circumstances, I‚Äôve actually never attended any academic conference in person ‚Äî I‚Äôm really grateful to my advisor for helping present some of my works. On one hand, I genuinely hope to have the chance to meet and connect with people face-to-face soon, but on the other hand, I can‚Äôt help but feel a strange kind of excitement about keeping this ‚Äúrecord‚Äù going. üòÇ
